# 30-days-lost-in-space
Arduino projects from the “30 Days Lost in Space” kit by Inventr.io. Includes circuits, sensors, and C++ code for each daily challenge. Built to learn embedded systems and hardware engineering.
This project simulates a basic motion-detection alarm system using an Arduino UNO and a PIR (passive infrared) sensor. When motion is detected, an LED turns on and a buzzer sounds an alert. This is part of my self-guided exploration in embedded systems and real-world sensor integration.

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Detects motion using a PIR sensor
- Triggers an LED and buzzer alarm
- Uses delay logic and serial output for debugging
- Simulates the kind of logic used in basic security systems or spacecraft proximity sensors

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to use digital input from a sensor
- Breadboarding and resistor selection
- Debouncing inputs and using the Serial Monitor for troubleshooting
- Programming with C++ in the Arduino IDE

## 🧰 Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO
- PIR Motion Sensor
- 1x LED
- 1x 220Ω resistor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add a push-button to reset the alarm
- Send data wirelessly using Bluetooth or ESP8266
- Display motion logs on an LCD
